      # updated with the commits from the second PR before the first PR's
      # workflow has a chance to push the commit generated by `npm version
      # patch`. This causes the first PR's `git push` step to fail after the
      # package has already been published, which in turn will cause all future
      # workflow runs to fail because they will all attempt to use the same
      # already-used version number. By running `npm publish` after `git push`,
      # back-to-back merges will cause the first merge's workflow to fail but
      # the second's will succeed.
