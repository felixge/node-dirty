# node-dirty

## Purpose

A tiny & fast key value store with append-only disk log. Ideal for apps with < 1 million records.

## Installation

```bash
npm install dirty
```

## Why dirty?

This module is called dirty because:

* The file format is newline separated JSON
* Your database lives in the same process as your application, they share memory
* There is no query language, you just `forEach` through all records

So dirty means that you will hit a very hard wall with this database after ~1 million records,
but it is a wonderful solution for anything smaller than that.

## Tutorial

```javascript
  var dirty = require('dirty');
  var db = dirty('user.db');

  db.on('load', function() {
    db.set('john', {eyes: 'blue'});
    console.log('Added john, he has %s eyes.', db.get('john').eyes);

    db.set('bob', {eyes: 'brown'}, function() {
      console.log('User bob is now saved on disk.')
    });

    db.forEach(function(key, val) {
      console.log('Found key: %s, val: %j', key, val);
    });
  });

  db.on('drain', function() {
    console.log('All records are saved on disk now.');
  });
```
Output:

    Added john, he has blue eyes.
    Found key: john, val: {"eyes":"blue"}
    Found key: bob, val: {"eyes":"brown"}
    User bob is now saved on disk.
    All records are saved on disk now.

## API

### new Dirty([path])

Creates a new dirty database. If `path` does not exist yet, it is created. You
can also omit the `path` if you don't want disk persistence (useful for testing).

The constructor can be invoked in multiple ways:

```javascript
require('dirty')('my.db');
require('dirty').Dirty('my.db');
new (require('dirty'))('my.db');
new (require('dirty').Dirty)('my.db');
```
### dirty.path

The path of the dirty database.

### dirty.set(key, value, [cb])

Set's the given `key` / `val` pair. The state of the database is affected instantly,
the optional `cb` callback is fired when the record was written to disk.

`val` can be any JSON-serializable type, it does not have to be an object.

### dirty.get(key)

Retrieves the value for the given `key`.

### dirty.rm(key, cb)

Removes the record with the given `key`. This is identical to setting the `key`'s value
to `undefined`.

### dirty.forEach(fn)

Calls the given `fn` function for every document in the database. The passed
arguments are `key` and `val`. You can return `false` to abort a query (useful
if you are only interested in a limited number of records).

This function is blocking and runs at ~4 Mhz.

### dirty event: 'load' (length)

Emitted once the database file has finished loading. It is not safe to access
records before this event fires. Writing records however should be fine.

`length` is the amount of records the database is holding. This only counts each
key once, even if it had been overwritten.

### dirty event: 'drain' ()

Emitted whenever all records have been written to disk.
